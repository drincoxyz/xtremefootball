## Description

Xtreme Football is a team-based game for
[s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/) inspired by
[JetBoom](https://github.com/JetBoom)'s
[Extreme Football Throwdown](https://github.com/JetBoom/extremefootballthrowdown)
gamemode for [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/).

The objective is to deliver the ball to the opposing team's end zones / goal
posts to score goals for your team, similar to American football. Unlike real
life American football however, there are no rules once the round has started -
beat your opponents senseless and use a variety of deadly and useful items to
ensure your team's victory. The team that reaches the target number of goals,
or has more goals than the opposing team when time runs out, wins the game.

fully playable yet as I continue to acquaint myself with the ever-changing
codebase in s&box.
